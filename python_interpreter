#This is proof to show python will compile first and create byte code called .pyc file
#Once you execute this command python -m python_interpreter.py in shell or cmd it will create byte (This is what we created creating just to showcase pyhton compiles file first)
#When we are not using -m during runtime python atomatically create compile file and delete it after execution


#steps:- 
#python -m python_interpreter.py
#python python_interpreter.pyc
